### Fibonacci, the golden ratio, and miles/kilometers

The Fibonacci numbers can be used to roughly estimate the numbers of kilometres in a mile. Cool!

Example:  
> 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...  
> 21/13 = 1.6154  
> 13/8 = 1.625  
> 8/5 = 1.6  

This ratio seems to tend towards the **Golen Ratio** the further into the Fibonacci sequence we go.

This code will test and chart this phenomenon, to see how quickly and how close this Fibonacci ratio tends toward the Golden Ratio
